            <h2>Write Inkspot, not Game of Life</h2>
            <p><p>Last Spring I was dawdling in a <a href="https://www.greymatterbookstore.com/">bookstore</a>, and happened across this <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262526319/cellular-automata-machines/">1987 book</a> about cellular automata. I had recently begun learning some graphics programming and thought this would be a great source of prompts. I gazed upon the book, which provided a sort of cellular automata version of “Hello, World”…no, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> - Inkspot! Inkspot was the perfect hook - it has basically one rule that when implemented made me feel like a genius, despite doing very little. I can’t ask for much more out of a first project!</p>
